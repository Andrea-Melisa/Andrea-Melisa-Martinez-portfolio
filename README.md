# Andrea-Melisa-Martinez-portfolio
My portfolio

## Description

This project is the second challenge from the bootcamp. In this case I needed to build my portfolio of work applying the core skills learned during the week such as: flex box, grid, media queries and CSS variables.  
The web needed to have name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about me, work, and how to contact me.
In the work section, the first application image should be larger in size than the others and when clicking the image the user should be taken to the deployed application.
Also the page should have a responsive layout and adapts to the viewport (computer screen or mobile).
So, that is what I haved learned and have tried to implement in the application.
